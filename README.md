A simple Python quiz app to practice German → English vocabulary.
The program shows a German word, and you type the English meaning.
It checks your answer and keeps your score.
Python 3.x should have installed on your computer.

Future Improvements:

Randomizing the order of flashcards,
adding "English → German" quiz option,
loading words from a text/CSV file,
keeping the track of wrong answers for review.
